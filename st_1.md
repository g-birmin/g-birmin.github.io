## Special Topic 1

The first special topic that I'd like to look into for this class is creating effecting changes in menus and UI for a site. Specifically the creation and implementation of an animated navigation menu for a website is what I am interested in learning and implementing on this site.


A major feature that I was looking into for this topic was a moving taskbar or menu, and how that animation is handled by the webpage. The example that I prepared for this task is specifically using a square that changes the background of the page to a dark theme, and adds links to the page when hovered over.

<style>
.square {
  height: 50px;
  width: 50px;
  background-color: #555;
}
</style>

<div class ="square"></div>

<div style="text-align: left"> <a href="/dp_4"> <-Prev </a> </div> <div style="text-align: right"> <a href="/st_2"> Next-> </a> </div>
