## Welcome to My Site

Hello there!
This is a site that I am using to demonstrate different basic design patterns and other projects assigned to me in a web design class I'm currently taking for school. Below this paragraph will be links around this site to the different examples that I was able to come up with. This site is worried primarily with showing my own understanding of the concepts that I was interested in, and as such other aspects of this site will be focused primarily on bare-bones presentation of the content.
