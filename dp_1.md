## Design Pattern 1

From the third chapter of the book _Designing Interfaces 2nd Edition_ is a chapter pertaining to moving around a website, and I felt that this chapter would make a good starting point, as it creates an opportunity to use a design pattern that can be applied to the site as a whole.

The design pattern that I chose to create for this chapter was the pyramid model of navigation. This pattern is when there is a set of pages on the same "layer" of the site, and because of that are connected through links that act similarly to pages of a book. These are often found near the bottom of a page, and will lead in an order determined by the designer, with only one or two options available, but all options being accessable through this method of "turning the page" as it were.
