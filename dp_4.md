## Design Pattern 4

The sixth chapter of the textbook is on the subject of action, the different elements that users interact with in nearly every website out there. As this is the final design pattern that I'm taking a look at in this series, I felt that a good way to end is by highlighting a simple pattern, the "Prominent 'Done' Button". Having a prominent done button displays two important things to users. It both symbolizes the ending of whatever section the user is finishing, and also gives an easy exit point for users.

(I couldn't think of a good way to mock-up this concept without making the working version sans-link.)
