## Design Pattern 2

The design patterns from the fourth chapter all center around the organization of pages on a site. The pattern that I chose for this chapter is "Titled Sections". Titled Sections refers generally to the signposting and separation of distinct sections within a page through explicit borders, or implicitly through things like the titles to different sections of a webpage.















<div style="text-align: right"> <a href="g-birmin.github.io/dp_1"> <-Prev </a> </div> <div style="text-align: right"> <a href="g-birmin.github.io/dp_3"> Next-> </a> </div>
