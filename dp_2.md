## Design Pattern 2

The design patterns from the fourth chapter all center around the organization of pages on a site. The pattern that I chose for this chapter is "Titled Sections". Titled Sections refers generally to the signposting and separation of distinct sections within a page through explicit borders, or implicitly through things like the titles to different sections of a webpage.


### Section A

Using a mixture of spacing and a large-font text, we are able to create something of an implicit barrier that creates blocks within the page. This allows for a user to separate the different sections automatically in one's head.

### Section B

An addition available to us is to also use a barrier to create a physical blocking of the sections. This can also be used vertically, to split a page or sections into columns.
