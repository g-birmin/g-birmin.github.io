## Design Pattern 3

The fifth chapter of the textbook deals with lists. The pattern that I chose to design for lists is the "One-Window Drilldown". The drilldown is a design pattern seen most obviously in old mobile formats, especially mobile e-mail apps. However this pattern is also utilized greatly in many social media feeds, seen on sites like Twitter and Instagram.

Working examples of this Pattern can be seen in nearly any list of options with one column, and the most simple way on interpreting that on a site like this is either in a list (as seen on the title page of this site) or a single column table, as seen below.
