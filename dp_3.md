## Design Pattern 3

The fifth chapter of the textbook deals with lists. The pattern that I chose to design for lists is the "One-Window Drilldown". The drilldown is a design pattern seen most obviously in old mobile formats, especially mobile e-mail apps. However this pattern is also utilized greatly in many social media feeds, seen on sites like Twitter and Instagram.
